Render a block from any template.

This is from Snippet 942: http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/942/ 
Which in turn was adapted from 769: http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/769/

Changes I've made:

1. Reformat code style to PEP-8 (in progress; I'm learning).


The description in snippet 769 has some usage examples, and this StackOverflow thread also provides an example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/882215/rendering-json-objects-using-a-django-template-after-an-ajax-call
